						<h3>About</h3>
						<p>Hi! I am a Front-End Web Designer and Developer in my second year of the three year Web Design & Interactive Media program at Humber College. While I am still in school, I also freelance on smaller projects and full-time during the summer.</p>
						<p>I have built a website, <a href="http://www.architravedesign.ca">www.architravedesign.ca</a>, for a local Toronto architect, and received positive feedback. I've also worked with the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) modifying their website to make it responsive on various devices. I am currently working on a WordPress site for the Leslieville Historical Society.</p>
						<p>I love the challenge of creating a solution to specific problems or enhancing a product to be more efficient and easier to use. Web development enables me to do this while incorporating my love of technology and design. Coding allows me to build a solution to a problem and have it develop in front of me. Although trained in web design, I prefer to work with a web design partner to bring their designs to life.</p>
						<p>During my spare time, I enjoy making personalized jewellery and greeting cards, exploring new features of technology, as well as reading.</p>
